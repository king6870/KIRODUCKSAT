    question: 'Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?',
    passage: 'Many archaeologists believe that the first humans to populate the Americas crossed a land bridge from Asia during the last Ice Age. However, recent discoveries of ancient tools and artifacts along the Pacific coast suggest that some early peoples may have traveled by boat, following a coastal route. This coastal migration theory challenges the traditional land bridge model and suggests that the peopling of the Americas was more complex than previously thought.',
    options: [
      'To argue that the land bridge theory is completely incorrect',
      'To present evidence for an alternative theory about early migration to the Americas',
      'To describe the tools used by early American peoples',
      'To explain why the Ice Age was important for human migration'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The text presents the coastal migration theory as an alternative to the traditional land bridge theory.',
