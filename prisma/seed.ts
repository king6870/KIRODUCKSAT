      passage: `Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Scientists worldwide have reached a consensus that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary drivers of recent global warming. The evidence is overwhelming: rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events all point to the urgent need for action.

However, addressing climate change requires more than just scientific understanding—it demands coordinated global action, innovative technologies, and fundamental changes in how we produce and consume energy. The transition to renewable energy sources, while challenging, offers both environmental benefits and economic opportunities for nations willing to invest in clean technology.`,
      options: [
        'Criticize scientists for their research methods',
        'Explain the scientific consensus on climate change and the need for action',
        'Argue against taking action on climate change',
        'Compare different types of fossil fuels'

      question: 'The passage most strongly suggests that renewable energy transition:',
      passage: `The shift toward renewable energy has accelerated dramatically in the past decade, driven by technological advances and decreasing costs. Solar panel efficiency has improved by 40% while costs have dropped by 70%. Wind turbines now generate electricity at prices competitive with traditional fossil fuel plants in many regions.

Despite these advances, the transition faces significant obstacles. Energy storage remains expensive and technically challenging, particularly for large-scale grid applications. Additionally, existing infrastructure investments in fossil fuel systems create economic incentives to delay the transition, even when renewable alternatives become cost-competitive.`,
